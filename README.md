### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 17 or higher 


- **IntelliJ IDEA** (or any other IDE)  


- **GitLab** for version control 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository from GitLab.
                


<p>&nbsp;</p>



####  Run Locally 

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
       

3. Go to:

        src/com/application/Application.java

4. Run "locally" when the option appears.
          

5. Use the **image generation buttons**, apply filters, and explore the Genetic Algorithm (GA) features.

#### Run remotely
           
4. Run:
     
        src/com/backend/BackendApplication.java
             
5. Once the backend is running, go back and run:
            
        src/com/application/Application.java
                                    
6. Run "remotely" when the option appears. 
                                          

7. Some functions are missing which need to be restored using API calls. 
             

### Features to Implement

✅ Undo / Redo functionality — allow users to reverse and reapply image edits.

✅ Save / Load functionality — enable saving generated images and loading user images.

✅ Image scaling customization — let users choose image resolution and scaling factor.

✅ Restore missing API calls in remote mode — make remote buttons and GA panel functional.

✅ Enable GA (Genetic Algorithm) generation in backend — offload image generation to backend.
