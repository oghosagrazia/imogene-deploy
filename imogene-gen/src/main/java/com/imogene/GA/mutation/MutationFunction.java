/**
 * Mutation functions are used to make changes in the generated
 * individuals, regardless of their fitness. Conventional
 * mutation functions will have some probabilistic elements,
 * such as the probability that the mutation will be applied,
 * or probability that certain elements will be affected.
 *
 * Greedy option is available. It makes the mutation run not once
 * but several times, returning only the fittest result. This is
 * generally against the spirit of GA although it may be useful
 * in tasks where defining suitable mutation functions is difficult.
 *
 * Do no harm option is available. This one will prevent the mutation
 * from happening if it will result in a lower fitness value. This is
 * generally against the spirit of GA, for the same reason.
