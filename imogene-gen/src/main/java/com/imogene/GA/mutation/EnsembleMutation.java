/**
 * An ensemble mutation function. It can store multiple mutation
 * functions and will use a random one whenever it is applied.
 *
 * New functions can be added using the addFunction method. In
 * addition to the mutation functions, their weights can be supplied.
 * The weights determine the likelihood of each function being applied.
 * For example, if there are 3 functions with weights 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5
 * than there is a 20% chance that the first one will be applied, 30%
 * the second and 50% the third. Function applications are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * When creating the functions to be used in ensemble, it is best to give
 * them all 100% chance of being applied to make sure the ensemble always
 * tries to apply one of them whenever its own probability is triggered.
